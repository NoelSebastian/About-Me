    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm a student at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania who loves tech, food and music. I'm working as a hedge fund analyst this summer in London and most of my work involves portfolio management and financial statistics. 

    Although my education and experience is mostly centered around finance and, specifically, investment management, I am keenly   interested in the amazing things that are happening in the tech industry today. As a rising senior, I'm currently trying to decide whether I want to continue on my finance track or do something more entrepreneurship-oriented.</p>
